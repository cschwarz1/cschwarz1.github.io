I am an independent information security consultant specializing in offensive security, red team operations, and adversary simulation. 

With a strong foundation in systems security, threat modeling, and operational risk, I work with organizations to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited — helping to bridge the gap between theoretical security and real-world attack surfaces.

When I’m not reverse-engineering binaries or bypassing controls, I explore high-performance living through biohacking,
cognitive enhancement, and strength training. I also enjoy reading, travel, psychology, finance and exploring how humans
and systems interact (and fail) in high-stakes environments. 

I like the outdoors to help balance my digital life, i'm into skydiving and mountain biking, tinkering with electronics and repairing or optimizing various gear.

I maintain this blog where I share research, insights, and reflections on security, freelancing, and operating in a rapidly evolving digital world.
